###FreshMeat Appliication

##Description:
Application storing food item from a virtual fridge. 
Items stored in a CRUD database and ordered based upon Use-By-Date.
User signs up to a mailer that sends an email selecting top three items that are going out of date next and provides a list of suggested recipes.
Nokogiri used to steal recipes information from Taste.com website(thanks to them).

###Areas for development
UI data entry needs to be automatic inorder to make this a viable idea.
